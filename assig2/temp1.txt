A Kernel is at the nucleus of a computer. It makes the communication between the hardware and software possible.
While the Kernel is the innermost part of an operating system, a shell is the outermost one.
A shell in a Linux operating system takes input from you in the form of commands, processes it,
and then gives an output. It is the interface through which a user works on the programs, commands, and scripts. A shell is accessed by a terminal which runs it.
